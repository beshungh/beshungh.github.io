          PORTFOLIO
        </h1>
        <p>
          I work at the intersection of software engineering and infrastructure, building data-driven applications while architecting, deploying, and managing the systems that power them. As a Database Developer and Data Scientist, I design efficient data models and pipelines, working extensively with SQL, Excel, Tableau, and Python to handle data ingestion, transformation, analysis, and visualization. On the backend, I develop scalable web applications using Django and Node.js, with a strong focus on performance, security, and direct database integration. Beyond application code, I design and manage server environments, cloud infrastructure, and deployment workflows using platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Render, DigitalOcean and Heroku. My experience spans server provisioning, environment configuration, networking fundamentals, and application deployment, ensuring reliability from development to production. I’m deeply invested in DevOps practices bridging development and operations to deliver systems that are scalable, maintainable, and resilient. Curious about the solutions I’ve built?

                SUPPLY CHAIN ANALYSIS <br />
              </a>
            </h2>
            <h3> Situation </h3>
            <p><em>The Global Superstore had been experiencing inefficiencies in its supply chain, resulting in increased costs and delays in product deliveries. The management team required a thorough analysis of their operations to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement. The dataset included sales, returns, and shipping information over several years, providing a comprehensive overview of the store's performance across different regions and product categories. Key questions aimed at addressing these challenges included identifying regions incurring the highest shipping costs and comparing them to others, understanding variations in average shipping costs across product categories, analysing the distribution of orders among different priorities and their impact on profitability, and identifying profit-driving product categories and sub-categories while devising strategies to optimize the product mix or marketing efforts for underperforming categories. Additionally, the company sought to determine which products had the highest return rates and assess the impact of returns on overall sales and profit, highlighting concerns about customer satisfaction, product quality, and revenue optimization.</em></p>
            <h3>Task</h3>
            <p>My primary goal was to extract actionable insights and generate detailed reports for stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance the company's performance. The analysis involved working with multiple datasets: "customers.csv," "orders.csv," "products.csv," and "returns.csv."</p>
            <h3>actions</h3>
            <p>To ensure data integrity, I started by cleaning currency symbols from columns using Excel. This step was crucial to prevent errors in future database queries.
            I then developed a Python script in Jupyter Notebook to automate the import of .csv files into a PostgreSQL database. Utilizing libraries such as os, shutil, NumPy, pandas, and psycopg2,the script:
            Organized files into a dedicated directory,Read CSV files into Pandas DataFrames, addressing encoding issues and Dynamically generated PostgreSQL-compatible table schemas and imported data using the high-performance COPY command.</p>
            <p>I conducted EDA in PostgreSQL to handle large datasets effectively, identifying key metrics and trends that informed decision-making. </p>
            <p>Using Tableau, I created interactive and comprehensive reports, making data interpretation straightforward for stakeholders. </p>
            <h3>Results</h3>
            <p>Shipping Costs Analysis: I identified regions with the highest shipping costs and their cost-to-profit ratios, leading to strategic recommendations for optimizing shipping operations. </p>
            <p>Product Category Analysis: By calculating the average shipping costs for different product categories, I revealed significant variations. This informed strategies for pricing adjustments and logistics optimization. </p>
            <p>Order Priority Analysis: Analyzing the distribution of orders by priority level and their impact on profitability provided insights into optimizing order handling processes to enhance overall profitability.</p>
            <p>Profitability Analysis: I identified high-profit and underperforming product categories, offering targeted recommendations to enhance profitability and optimize the product mix. </p>
            <p>Return Rate Analysis: Determining the products with the highest return rates and their impact on sales and profit led to strategies for improving product quality and customer satisfaction. </p>
            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>This project highlighted my proficiency in managing complex datasets and conducting thorough analysis. It also showcased my capabilities in automating data processes and generating actionable insights.
